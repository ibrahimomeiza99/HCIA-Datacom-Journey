## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a cybersecurity analyst documenting my hands-on learning journey through the **HCIA-Datacom** certification program by Huawei. This repository serves as my personal knowledge base, lab portfolio, and technical reference — capturing everything I learn, build, and troubleshoot along the way.

Understanding network infrastructure at this level is foundational to my work in cybersecurity. You cannot effectively defend a network you don't understand how to build.

## 🎯 Goals

- [ ] Complete all HCIA-Datacom lab modules
- [ ] Pass the HCIA-Datacom exam (H12-811)
- [ ] Build a practical reference library of Huawei VRP commands
- [ ] Connect networking fundamentals to real-world cybersecurity scenarios
- [ ] Document every lab with full configurations and verification outputs

## ⚡ Quick Command Reference

A snapshot of the most frequently used Huawei VRP commands. Full cheat sheets are in the `/cheatsheets` folder.

```bash
# Enter system view
<Huawei> system-view

# Set device hostname
[Huawei] sysname R1

# Configure an interface
[R1] interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
[R1-GE0/0/0] ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
[R1-GE0/0/0] undo shutdown

# Add a static route
[R1] ip route-static 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2

# Display routing table
[R1] display ip routing-table

# Display interface status
[R1] display interface brief

# Save configuration
[R1] save
```

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Relevance

As a cybersecurity analyst, this certification strengthens my ability to:

- **Understand attack surfaces** — Knowing how routing and switching work helps me identify where attackers can intercept, spoof, or disrupt traffic
- **Analyze network traffic** — Understanding protocols like OSPF, STP, and VLANs makes packet analysis in tools like Wireshark far more meaningful
- **Harden network devices** — Configuring ACLs, AAA, and SSH on Huawei devices mirrors real-world network hardening tasks
- **Perform network reconnaissance** — Understanding how networks are built helps me conduct more effective and accurate network mapping during assessments
- **Communicate with network teams** — Speaking the language of network engineers makes cross-team collaboration during incident response far more effective
